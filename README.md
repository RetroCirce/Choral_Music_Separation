This is the official implementation repository of "[Improving Choral Music Separation through Expressive Synthesized Data from Sampled Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02871)", ISMIR 2022.

The datasets used in the paper are available at: [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MoCWjofikml109Zb_wedFCDbYUHDqie_?usp=share_link)

The demo of the paper is shown at: [demo page](https://retrocirce.github.io/cms_demo/)

The released code is able to reproduce the results, but it is still organized in progress. The new folder structure with an instruction on the code will be uploaded soon.
